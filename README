For the test You can use  the bitnam spark cluster available here :

https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/spark/

and launch this command :

helm install test bitnami/spark --set image.tag=3.1.2


For minikube testing you will need to build the beam-job image locally :

eval $(minikube docker-env) 

docker build -t beam_python_from_jira .


In order to see the logs ; you will need to connect to the executor interface , better to use lens :)
